Ask a student about the importance of time who has failed in an exam, ask a patient about the importance of time who just get to know that he or she has not much time to live, ask a mother about the importance of time when has delivered a baby. Time is same for everyone but plays different roles in everyone’s life. It teaches us that everything and everyone moves on.

Time is the greatest gift in one’s life. It is like money for us and we waste it foolishly and thoughtlessly in meaningless activities but great people make the use of time in its best possible way because they know how valuable it is. They know that “Time and tide wait for none” and “Once it gets lost can never be recovered”. Wasting time means wasting opportunities and if it slips from our hand, it can never be gained. It is more powerful than the kings and queens because they can come and go but time is forever. It has neither a beginning nor an end. What is important is the present. It is simply stupid to postpone your work on tomorrow. It is like regretting the lost past. There is no tomorrow or yesterday, it is always “today”. Today means hard work, labor, sweat, and efforts. Work done on time is earned. It is no use to strike the iron when it is cold; the right time is when it is hot.
